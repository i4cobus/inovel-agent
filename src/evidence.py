"""Independent evidence sampling for evaluation.

The recommender profiles a novel from a fixed set of sampled chapters. If a judge
scored relevance from those same chapters it would only be answering "does this
profile match the query", not "does this *book* match the query", and would
inherit every sampling error the system made. That is circular, and it would hide
exactly the failures evaluation exists to find.

So judge evidence is drawn from chapters the profile did **not** use. Both sides
call ``profile_chapter_indices``: the profile to pick its chapters, this module to
avoid them. Which of the remaining chapters get picked is derived from the novel
id, so a book always yields the same evidence across runs — verdict caching keys
on the evidence, and re-sampling would silently invalidate it.

The author's synopsis is the one deliberate exception. It is shared with the
profile, so agreement between judge and system is inflated slightly by it. That
is the lesser evil: the synopsis is the only place a novel states its genre
outright, and withholding it produced evidence a human annotator could not judge
against the query at all. A noisy judge poisons everything downstream; a bounded,
documented overlap does not. Independence is preserved where it actually
matters — which *narrative* the two sides read.
