"""LLM-as-judge relevance labelling with a hard spend cap.

The corpus has no relevance labels, so system comparisons rest on judged
verdicts. Two properties make those verdicts worth trusting:

1. The judge reads evidence the *system never saw* (see ``src/evidence.py``),
   so it grades the book rather than the system's own summary of it.
2. Spend is bounded by the endpoint-reported ``usage``, not by an estimate.
   ``BudgetGuard`` refuses to start a run it cannot afford and stops mid-run the
   moment the cap is reached, flushing whatever completed.

Verdicts use the same schema as the human annotation sheet
(``relevance_label`` 0/1/2 plus ``constraint_violation``) so judge and human
columns can be compared directly with Cohen's kappa.

      evidence it violates" set the burden of proof too high. Presence of the
